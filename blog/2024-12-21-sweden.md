We went on a trip to Sweden above the arctic circle. On this trip, the Aurora made its appearance.

At the Aurora River Camp the Northern Lights can often fill the sky.

While we had to stay up at night to watch the lights, we could not sleep during the day and had great experiences like dog sledding.

Starting our run!

For snowmobiles and dog sleds alike, this frozen river was a highway!

While we were sledding, the dog in the back left, Rio, pulled the hardest.

Naturally, we also spent time with these charming animals.

Similar to cattle, reindeer herders sometimes have to lasso their deer.
