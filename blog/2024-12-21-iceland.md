While touring a glacier in Iceland, there was an arctic fox that lived there!

He is quite used to seeing travelers pay him a visit.

We spent a few moments watching him search for food.

We saw the fox at a glacier near Vik which is famous for its black sand beaches.

Visiting in winter and seeing the black sand mixed with white snow is a treat.

Vik is also where one can see someone work with lava indoors. Here we learned that the entire town of Vik is threatened by a neighboring volcano and will almost certainly be destroyed one day.

The Aurora made its appearance in Iceland as well!
